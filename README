Release Notes:

Version 0.1 12/12/2011
First working version, supportland.php.  Grabs my own personal card info from
the API as XML, parses it, and outputs it.  Also uses a teensy bit of jQuery
which was just for the presentation.  Note that hooking into wp_head like this
does is not a good idea, we should use shortcode.

Version 0.2 01/27/2012
Centeral library for handling API. User authentication and session handling.
"Mini-widget" with short code that can be dropped into posts and comments.
Initial iteration of main widget. Main widget now has user info and wallet
views. Plugin settings page for storing app_token. All hard coded tokens
have been removed from code base. Unit tests.
