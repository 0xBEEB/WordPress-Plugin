Version 0.1 12/12/2011
First working version, supportland.php.  Grabs my own personal card info from
the API as XML, parses it, and outputs it.  Also uses a teensy bit of jQuery
which was just for the presentation.  Note that hooking into wp_head like this
does is not a good idea, we should use shortcode.
